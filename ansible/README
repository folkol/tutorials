# Ansible

Ansible is a configuration management and provisioning tool, similar to Chef, Puppet or Salt.

- It's just SSH
- Easy to convert Bash scripts into Ansible Tasks
- Ansible automates getting context before running Task
- Ansible Tasks are idempotent
- Ansible use 'Facts', which are system and environment information that it
  gathers ("Context") before running Tasks
- Ansible uses these facts to check state and see if it needs to change
  anything in order to get the desired outcome. This makes it safe to run
  Ansible Tasks against a server over and over again.
- Agentless
- Can be run on any machine that has got Ansible installed, but is usually run
  from a central server

# Install

```
$ brew install ansible
```
