<h1>Web page tutorial</h1>

<p>In this tutorial, we are going to create a web page – this web page!</p>

<p>The tutorial consists of three parts, one for each of the basic web page building blocks – HTML, CSS and JS.</p>

<ul>
    <li>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language): A language for structuring the contents of a web page. Declares what various
        parts of the web page are.
    </li>
    <li>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets): A set of style rules that define how the various elements of the web page should
        look.
    </li>
    <li>JS (JavaScript): A programming language. JavaScript can be used to dynamically update the contents of a web
        page, or send instructions to the Browser.
    </li>
</ul>

<p class="warning">Make sure that you are using a plain text editor (Notepad, Sublime Text), and not a 'rich text' word
    processor that embeds additional information in the file, when working through this tutorial.
</p>

<h2>HTML – Hypertext Markup Language</h2>

<p>In this section, we will introduce HTML, elements, attributes and the DOM.</p>

<h3></h3>






- Plain text -> markup some sections (headings, links?)
- Copy the heading and the first section from this tutorial [img]
- Paste it in a file called index.html, open in a Browser
- Mark up the heading to be a heading.
- Mark up a portion in the text as a link.
- Fill in DOCTYPE, html/head/body
- Implied tags/elements?
- Note about optional tags, but how they are still actually elements.
- Elements vs tags vs DOM nodes?
- User agent parsing of HTML to DOM tree?
- Types of elements?
