Web page tutorial

In this tutorial, we are going to create a web page – this web page!

The tutorial consists of three parts, one for each of the basic web page building blocks: HTML, CSS and JS.

HTML (Hypertext Markup Language): A (markup-) language for structuring the contents of a web page. Declares what various parts of the web page are.
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets): A set of style rules that define how the various elements of the web page should look.
JS (JavaScript): A programming language. JavaScript can be used to dynamically update the page, e.g. manipulate the DOM or otherwise instruct the Browser to do something.
Make sure that you are using a plain text editor (Notepad, Sublime Text), and not a 'rich text' word processor that embeds additional information in the file, when working through this tutorial.

HTML – Hypertext Markup Language

In this section, we will introduce HTML, elements, attributes and the DOM.

HTML is a markup language that adds meaning and structure to a text by the means of tags. HTML tags defines what parts of the document ARE.

Getting started

Create a folder for your web page.
Create an empty text file with the file extension '.html' (e.g. 'index.html').
Open the file with a web Browser, it should look like a blank page.
Copy all text from this page and paste it into your html file. Refresh the Browser – it should display a blob of text.

Markup

The reason why your web page looks like poop is that it has got no encoded structure. We can begin adding some structure by tagging – or marking up – the headline as such.

Marked up heading

Enclosing a section of the text in tags like that will declare that part of the page to be a heading.

There are six levels of headings, h1 means "the most important heading", h2 means "the second most important heading" etc.

Elements

A section of the document tagged up like this is called an "element". There are a few different kinds of elements, for example "normal elements", "raw text elements" and "void elements".

When a "User agent" (e.g. a Browser) is parsing (i.e. reading through and interpreting) HTML code, it will build up a tree structure corresponding to these elements in memory. This tree is called 'the DOM' (Document Object Model), and the nodes in this tree are called "DOM Nodes".

Inspect your the heading with your Browser's Developer Tools. You will notice that it is not alone, but sits in a hierarchy of parent nodes.

Implicit elements

The reason for this is that HTML has got a notion of optional tags. Some elements are mandatory and will be created according to some scheme whether you actually add their tags to your HTML code or not. My suggestion is that you add the tags for the root element (html), the document metadata element (head) and the document content element (body) to your HTML code.

Mark the rest of the heading elements with suitable h-tags (h2, h3, h4 etc.).

Links – or anchor – elements

Hyperlinks are THE defining trait of the WWW. A section of a web page is marked as a hyperlink by the "a" tag.

The href attribute is a URL (or a URL fragment): http://somedomain:port/some/path#somefragment

If the address part is skipped, the URL is considered relative to the current page.
The fragment name is the "id" attribute of an element on the given page.
Doctype

There are several different HTML standards out in the wild. A special tag is used to declare which one a certain document should be interpreted as. It should be the first tag of the HTML page.

The latest version of HTML is called "HTML 5", and it's DOCTYPE tag looks like this:

<!DOCTYPE html>

HTML Entities

HTML entities can be used to "escape" from special interpretation – for example when you want to actually print out less than (<), greater than (>) or – for that matter – the ampersand. &.

Summary

HTML pages are text files annotated, or marked up with, tags.
HTML pages are parsed by user agents, for example web browsers, into a DOM tree.
The primary purpose of HTML is to describe the structure and the semantics of the various parts of the page.
CSS – Cascading Style Sheets

In this section, we will introduce CSS, selectors, declaration blocks and properties.

Getting started

JS – JavaScript

In this section, we will introduce JS, Script-tags, functions and the event loop.
