<h1>Web page tutorial</h1>

In this tutorial, we are going to create a web page – this web page!

The tutorial consists of three parts, one for each of the basic web page building blocks – HTML, CSS and JS.

HTML (Hypertext Markup Language): A language for structuring the contents of a web page. Declares what various parts of the web page are.
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets): A set of style rules that define how the various elements of the web page should look.
JS (JavaScript): A programming language. JavaScript can be used to dynamically update the contents of a web page, or send instructions to the Browser.
Make sure that you are using a plain text editor (Notepad, Sublime Text), and not a 'rich text' word processor that embeds additional information in the file, when working through this tutorial.

HTML

- Plain text -> markup some sections (headings, links?) - Copy the heading and the first section from this tutorial [img] - Paste it in a file called index.html, open in a Browser - Mark up the heading to be a heading. - Mark up a portion in the text as a link. - Fill in DOCTYPE, html/head/body - Implied tags/elements? - Note about optional tags, but how they are still actually elements. - Elements vs tags vs DOM nodes? - User agent parsing of HTML to DOM tree? - Types of elements?
CSS

Info boxes: Note Definition Trivia DOM: An in-memory representation of the page. A 'tree' of 'nodes'. Omnigraffle diagrams for everything! References: https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/introduction.html https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/HTML/Element
