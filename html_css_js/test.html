Getting started
In this tutorial, we are going to create a web page – this web page!

<p>The tutorial consists of three parts, one for each of the basic web page building blocks: HTML, CSS and JS.</p>

HTML (Hypertext Markup Language): A language for structuring the contents of a web page. Declares what various parts of
the web page are.
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets): A set of style rules that define how the various elements of the web page should look.
JS (JavaScript): A programming language. JavaScript can be used to dynamically update the page, e.g. manipulate the DOM
or otherwise instruct the Browser to do something.
Make sure that you are using a plain text editor (Notepad, Sublime Text), and not a 'rich text' word processor that
embeds additional information in the file, when working through this tutorial.

<h2>HTML – Hypertext Markup Language</h2>

In this section, we will introduce HTML, elements, attributes and the DOM.

HTML is a markup language that adds meaning and structure to a text by the means of tags. HTML tags defines what parts
of the document ARE.

Getting started

Create a folder for your web page.
Create an empty text file with the file extension '.html' (e.g. 'index.html').
Open the file with a web Browser, it should look like a blank page.
Copy all text from this page and paste it into your html file. Refresh the Browser – it should display a blob of text.
Unmarked text

Markup

The reason why your web page looks like poop is that it has got no encoded structure. We can begin adding some structure
by tagging – or marking up – the headline as such.

Marked up heading

Enclosing a section of the text in tags like that will declare that part of the page to be a heading.

There are six levels of headings, h1 means "the most important heading", h2 means "the second most important heading"
etc.

Elements

A section of the document tagged up like this is called an "element". There are a few different kinds of elements, for
example "normal elements", "raw text elements" and "void elements".

When a "User agent" (e.g. a Browser) is parsing (i.e. reading through and interpreting) HTML code, it will build up a
tree structure of Node elements in memory. This tree is called 'the DOM' (Document Object Model).

Inspect your the heading with your Browser's Developer Tools. You will notice that it sits in a hierarchy of nodes,
'html' > 'body' > 'h1'.

Implicit elements

- Plain text -> markup some sections (headings, links?) - Copy the heading and the first section from this tutorial
[img] - Paste it in a file called index.html, open in a Browser - Mark up the heading to be a heading. - Mark up a
portion in the text as a link. - Fill in DOCTYPE, html/head/body - Implied tags/elements? - Note about optional tags,
but how they are still actually elements. - Elements vs tags vs DOM nodes? - Spacing - User agent parsing of HTML to DOM
tree? - Types of elements?

CSS – Cascading Style Sheets

In this section, we will introduce CSS, selectors, declaration blocks and properties.

Getting started

JS – JavaScript

In this section, we will introduce JS, Script-tags, functions and the event loop.
