Web page tutorial

In this tutorial, we are going to create a web page – this web page!

The tutorial consists of three parts, one for each of the basic web page building blocks – HTML, CSS and JS.

HTML (Hypertext Markup Language): A language for structuring the contents of a web page. Declares what various parts of the web page are.
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets): A set of style rules that define how the various elements of the web page should look.
JS (JavaScript): A programming language. JavaScript can be used to dynamically update the contents of a web page, or send instructions to the Browser.
Make sure that you are using a plain text editor (Notepad, Sublime Text), and not a 'rich text' word processor that embeds additional information in the file, when working through this tutorial.

HTML – Hypertext Markup Language

In this section, we will introduce HTML, elements, attributes and the DOM.

HTML is a markup language that adds meaning and structure to a text by the means of tags. A HTML tag defines what a part of the document IS.

Getting started

Create a folder for your web page.
Create an empty text file, with the file extension ".html".
Open the file with a web Browser, it should look like a blank page.
Copy all text from this page, and paste it into your html file. Refresh the Browser. It should look like a blob of text.

Markup

The reason why your web page looks like poop is that it has got no encoded structure. We can begin adding some structure by tagging, or marking, the headline as such.

When a "User agent" (e.g. a Browser) is parsing html code, it

- Plain text -> markup some sections (headings, links?) - Copy the heading and the first section from this tutorial [img] - Paste it in a file called index.html, open in a Browser - Mark up the heading to be a heading. - Mark up a portion in the text as a link. - Fill in DOCTYPE, html/head/body - Implied tags/elements? - Note about optional tags, but how they are still actually elements. - Elements vs tags vs DOM nodes? - User agent parsing of HTML to DOM tree? - Types of elements?

CSS – Cascading Style Sheets

In this section, we will introduce CSS, selectors, declaration blocks and properties.

JS – JavaScript

In this section, we will introduce JS, Script-tags, functions and the event loop.
