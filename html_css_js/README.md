In this tutorial, we are going to create a web page – this web page!

The tutorial is split up in three parts, one for each basic building block of a web page – HTML, CSS and JS.

HTML – Hypertext Markup Language: A format for structuring the contents of a web page with the help of <tags>. Defines what various parts of the web page IS.
CSS – Cascading Style Sheets: A set of instructions for how 
JS – JavaScript: A programming language. JavaScript I can be used to dynamically update the contents of a web page, or send various instructions to the Browswer.  

[Note: Make sure that you are using a plain text editor (Notepad, Sublime Text), and not a 'rich text' word processor that embeds additional information in the file, when working through this tutorial.]

    - Paste it in a file called index.html, open in a Browser
    - Mark up the heading to be a heading.
    - Mark up a portion in the text as a link.
 - Fill in DOCTYPE, html/head/body
 - Implied tags/elements?
 - Note about optional tags, but how they are still actually elements.
 - Elements vs tags vs DOM nodes?
 - User agent parsing of HTML to DOM tree?
 - Types of elements?
